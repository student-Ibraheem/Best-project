    <div class="about">ABOUT US</div><br><br>
   <div class="para"> In 2019, we first founded the German-language Kalender.digital. Due to the great popularity, we founded the international version Calendar.online one year later in 2020. <br><br>

In the meantime, we are the largest online calendar in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. More than 100,000 satisfied users, including renowned corporate customers such as Siemens and Mercedes, take advantage of our offer. Our calendar is also used in schools, churches, clubs and families. <br><br>

Our focus is not only on ease of use, data protection is also important to us. That's why we store as little data as possible and do not sell it to third parties. We also attach great importance to fast servers with high availability - this means that they are online 99.99% of the time. This means that the calendar can be accessed at any time. Another advantage that distinguishes us from other providers is that we do not place annoying advertisements. <br><br>

Whether in the office, in the family, or as a school class - our calendar inspires in every area. Keep your appointments always in view by creating the calendar on the common devices such as smartphone, tablet and computer. Even "c't", the largest computer technology magazine in Europe, came to the conclusion in a test comparison on the subject of "online calendars" that Calendar.online enriches everyday life. <br><br>

Take a look at our live demo (without registration) to find out if Calendar.online helps you organize your everyday life. <br><br>
